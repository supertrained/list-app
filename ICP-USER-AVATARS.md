## 1. Market Context: The Problem L.I.S.T. Solves <a name="market-context"></a>

### The Scale of the Problem

- **4.2 million Australians** are aged 65+ (ABS 2024), with this number growing rapidly as baby boomers age.
- **49% of people aged 65-74** receive a government pension or allowance as their main income source (AIHW). This rises significantly with age: 26% of those aged 65-69 receive the Age Pension, jumping to 59% of those aged 70-74.
- **82% of Age Pension applicants** sought assistance with the application process -- they did not feel confident enough to go it alone (National Seniors/Retirement Essentials survey, n=530).
- **88% of people** surveyed were dissatisfied with Age Pension application forms and processes.
- **95% of respondents** were dissatisfied with the Centrelink call centre, primarily relating to wait times.

### The Digital Divide Is Real

According to the **Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII) 2025**:

| Age Group | ADII Score Gap vs National Average | Digital Exclusion Rate |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| 55-64     | -3.8 points                       | ~15%                 |
| 65-74     | -12.1 points                      | ~30%                 |
| 75+       | -24.6 points                      | 66.5%                |

- Only **6 in 10** Australians over 65 are regular internet users.
- **73% of those aged 65+** need help setting up and learning to use new devices.
- People aged 75+ need to spend **more than 10% of household income** on internet access (12% of this group), with 65-74 year-olds (8%) also disproportionately affected.
- The largest gains in digital ability were among those 75+, whose scores rose from 23.3 to 41.5 between 2023-2025 -- showing demand and willingness to engage, but from a very low base.

### The Government Service Experience Is Broken

- MyGov was described by the Digital Transformation Agency's own research as using **"difficult language, complex instructions"** and frequently leaving users **"locked out of their accounts."**
- The top three MyGov complaints: **login difficulties; problems linking to member services; "not user friendly."**
- Seniors described MyGov as a **"painful experience"** with **"nothing intuitive about it,"** where **"the interfaces to each department are like crossing a moat designed to keep you out, or locked in."**
- Average Centrelink call wait time: **26-32 minutes** (2024), with maximum waits recorded at **2 hours and 54 minutes** in a single financial year.
- COTA Australia warned that **"a digital-only policy -- whether from government, business, or academia -- can be seen as a form of ageism."**

## 2. Primary Avatar: "Margaret" -- The Core User (65-75, Retiree) <a name="primary-avatar"></a>

### 2.1 Demographics

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Margaret (representative name) |
| **Age** | 68-72 (sweet spot within the 65-75 range) |
| **Gender Split** | ~55% female, ~45% male in this age cohort accessing government services. Women slightly over-represented because they are more likely to be widowed, have lower super balances, and depend more heavily on Age Pension. |
| **Location** | Suburban Sydney (Western Sydney, Sutherland Shire, Central Coast) or regional NSW (Hunter Valley, Illawarra, Mid-North Coast). 82.7% inner regional and 80.7% outer regional areas have home internet access, compared to 87.9% in major cities. |
| **Income Level** | Primary income from Age Pension: $1,178.70/fortnight single ($30,646/year) or $1,777.00/fortnight couple ($46,202/year combined) as of September 2025. May have modest superannuation supplement. 49% of 65-74 year-olds receive government pension as main income. |
| **Living Situation** | Owns home outright (typical for this cohort -- average home value $597,000 for over-65 households). Lives alone (if widowed) or with partner. Increasingly, some are in retirement villages or considering the transition. |
| **Education** | Mixed. May have completed high school and/or trade qualification. Less likely to hold a university degree than younger cohorts. |
| **Marital Status** | Married/partnered (60%) or widowed/separated (40%). Widowhood is a major trigger event for needing to navigate government services solo for the first time. |

### 2.2 Digital Literacy Level

**Overall:** Low-to-moderate. ADII score 12.1 points below the national average for 65-74 group.

**Devices owned and used:**
- **Tablet (iPad):** Often the preferred device. Larger screen makes reading easier. ~58% of 65+ use a desktop/laptop, but tablets are increasingly favoured for their simplicity and portability.
- **Smartphone:** 78% of seniors aged 65-75 own a smartphone (Deloitte). Used primarily for calls, text messages, WhatsApp to family, and basic photo sharing. Less comfortable using smartphone for complex tasks (forms, government portals).
- **Desktop/laptop:** May have an older computer. Used for email, occasional web browsing, and online banking (if set up by family member).
- **Smart TV:** May use for streaming (set up by children/grandchildren).

**What they are comfortable with:**
- Making and receiving phone calls
- Text messaging (SMS, WhatsApp)
- Email (checking, basic sending)
- Facebook (passive browsing, family photos -- 35.3% of 65-74s use social networking)
- Online banking (if initially set up by someone else, used cautiously)
- Video calls with family (Zoom, FaceTime -- gained adoption during COVID)

**What frustrates them:**
- **Passwords and login systems:** Forgetting passwords, being locked out, multi-factor authentication codes. MyGov lockouts are extremely common -- 9 failed attempts triggers a lockout.
- **Jargon and bureaucratic language:** Government websites use terms they don't understand ("deemed income," "assets test threshold," "linking code").
- **Small text and cluttered interfaces:** Poor contrast, tiny buttons, information overload on government pages.
- **Pop-ups, cookie notices, and security warnings:** Create anxiety and confusion. "Am I being scammed?"
- **Timeout sessions:** Government portals time out, losing partially completed forms.
- **Multi-step processes:** "Why do I need 6 screens to do one thing?"
- **Error messages that don't explain what went wrong:** Generic errors with no plain-English guidance.

### 2.3 Psychographics

#### Fears (ranked by intensity)

1. **Being scammed or defrauded online**
   - 84% of Australians 50+ have either encountered or been victims of a scam.
   - 83% say they worry about scams.
   - Australians aged 65+ reported 62,147 scams with $99.6 million in losses in 2024.
   - 1 in 4 report an AI-related scam experience.
   - This fear creates a **chilling effect**: they avoid doing things online because "what if it's not real?"

2. **Making a mistake that costs them money**
   - Terrified of accidentally reporting something wrong to Centrelink and either losing payments or incurring a debt (the "Robodebt" trauma is still culturally fresh).
   - Fear of clicking the wrong button and authorising something they didn't mean to.
   - Fear of not understanding what they're agreeing to in online forms.

3. **Losing independence / becoming a burden**
   - Baby boomers strongly value autonomy and independence.
   - 68% of Australians want to age in place.
   - Needing to ask children for help with "simple" tasks like checking their pension online feels humiliating.
   - Being unable to manage their own affairs signals a loss of competence.

4. **Privacy and data security**
   - "Who can see my information?"
   - Distrust of what happens to data once submitted online.
   - Heightened awareness of data breaches (Optus, Medibank hacks are culturally significant in Australia).

5. **Being left behind / the world moving on without them**
   - Government pushing "digital by default" feels exclusionary.
   - Bank branches closing, phone services being replaced by chatbots.
   - "I used to be able to just walk in and talk to someone."

#### Motivations

1. **Maintaining independence and dignity**
   - Wants to handle own affairs without needing to ask for help.
   - "I managed a household / a business / a career -- I should be able to figure out my pension."

2. **Financial security**
   - Getting the correct pension entitlements. Not leaving money on the table.
   - Understanding what they're eligible for after a life event (partner's death, health change).

3. **Peace of mind**
   - Knowing they've done things correctly.
   - Not having a Centrelink debt hanging over them.
   - Understanding their rights and entitlements in plain language.

4. **Staying connected to the world**
   - Government services increasingly require digital engagement.
   - Wants to participate, not be excluded.

5. **Protecting themselves and their partner**
   - Making sure they're not missing out on benefits.
   - Planning ahead for aged care transitions.

#### Values

1. **Trust:** Will only use services that feel safe, legitimate, and Australian. Government backing or endorsement matters enormously.
2. **Simplicity:** Wants things explained once, clearly, without jargon. "Just tell me what I need to do."
3. **Privacy:** Wants assurance their data isn't being sold or shared.
4. **Respect:** Doesn't want to be talked down to. Wants to be treated as an intelligent adult who simply finds the system confusing.
5. **Reliability:** Wants consistent, correct answers. If the tool says something, it must be right.

### 2.4 Journey: What Triggers Them to Need This Tool

These are the **life events** that drive Margaret to seek help navigating government services:

| Trigger Event | What Happens | Government Complexity |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Turning 67 (Age Pension eligibility)** | Needs to apply for the Age Pension for the first time. | The application process is described as "too hard, too complicated and too long." 42.4% of applicants were dissatisfied. Income and assets tests are confusing. |
| **Partner passing away** | Must notify Centrelink, adjust pension from couple to single rate, deal with estate matters, change Medicare details. | Emotionally devastating timing meets maximum bureaucratic complexity. Must update multiple agencies while grieving. |
| **Health event (stroke, fall, diagnosis)** | Suddenly needs to understand hospital costs, Medicare coverage, NDIS eligibility, home care packages. | My Aged Care assessment process (now Single Assessment System from Dec 2024) is complex. Wait times of 2-6 weeks for assessment. |
| **Moving to aged care** | Needs to understand means-tested fees, accommodation deposits, impact on pension. | Aged care costs are notoriously opaque. RAD vs DAP, means-tested care fees, impact on family home assessment. |
| **Pension rate changes** | Government changes deeming rates, income thresholds, or asset limits. | Changes happen twice yearly (March and September). Hard to understand personal impact without recalculating. |
| **Helping a partner who is declining** | Becomes a carer while also managing their own entitlements. | May be eligible for Carer Payment or Carer Allowance but doesn't know. Additional forms and assessments required. |
| **Downsizing home** | Selling the family home. Impact on pension assets test. Downsizer super contribution rules. | Extremely complex intersection of Centrelink assets test, capital gains, super rules, and pension impact. |

### 2.5 Current Behaviour: How They Currently Get Answers

| Method | Usage | Experience |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Call Centrelink/Services Australia** | First instinct. "I'll just ring them." | Average wait: 26-32 minutes. Maximum recorded: 2h 54m. 95% dissatisfaction with call centres. Often get different answers from different operators. Sometimes disconnected after waiting. |
| **Ask a family member (daughter/son)** | Very common, especially for anything online. | Creates dependency and guilt. Family member may not know the answer either. Creates friction ("Mum, I'm at work, I can't do this right now"). |
| **Visit a Services Australia office** | Strongly preferred by this cohort. | Offices increasingly directing people to online services. Wait times in person can also be long. Fewer offices in regional areas. COVID reduced face-to-face availability. |
| **Ask a friend/peer** | Informal peer network at bowls club, church, community group. | Information is often anecdotal, incomplete, or wrong. "My friend Shirley said..." |
| **Avoid it entirely** | More common than acknowledged. | Result: miss entitlements, overpay for services, don't claim what they're owed. Silent suffering. |
| **Use a financial adviser** | Small percentage, usually those with more assets. | Expensive. Many retirees on the pension cannot afford one. |
| **Google it** | Increasingly common, but overwhelming. | Government websites are dense. Search results mix official info with ads and scam sites. Hard to know what's current/relevant. |
| **Be Connected / community programs** | Growing usage -- 2 million learners through the eSafety Be Connected program. | Helpful for basic digital skills but doesn't solve the government-service-specific complexity. |

### 2.6 Pain Points with Government Digital Services (Specific)

1. **MyGov account management**
   - Locked out of accounts frequently (9 failed login attempts triggers lockout).
   - Linking services (Centrelink, Medicare, ATO) is confusing and often fails.
   - Multi-factor authentication adds friction.
   - After setting up MyID, some users now face two-stage login processes.

2. **Centrelink online claims**
   - Age Pension application requires extensive financial documentation.
   - Forms time out, losing progress.
   - "Deemed income" concept is fundamentally confusing to non-financial people.
   - Assets test calculation is opaque.
   - Error messages are unhelpful.

3. **Medicare online**
   - Claiming is relatively straightforward, but understanding bulk billing vs gap fees is confusing.
   - Medicare Safety Net thresholds are hard to track.
   - Linking Medicare to MyGov frequently fails.

4. **My Aged Care portal**
   - "Navigating the aged care system can be confusing" -- the portal's own acknowledgment.
   - Assessment process recently changed (Single Assessment System from December 2024), adding confusion.
   - Understanding the difference between home care packages, CHSP, and residential care is overwhelming.
   - Wait times between application and assessment: 2-6 weeks.

5. **Language and readability**
   - Government websites written at a reading level far above what's comfortable for many seniors.
   - Heavy use of acronyms (ACAT, RAS, CHSP, HCP, RAD, DAP, MPIR).
   - Legal disclaimers and caveats make everything sound uncertain.
   - "I just want to know: am I eligible? How much will I get?"

6. **Lack of personalisation**
   - Every government website provides generic information.
   - "Here are 47 pages about the Age Pension. Good luck figuring out which bits apply to you."
   - No tool says: "Based on what you've told me, here's what you need to do next."

## 3. Secondary Avatar: "David" -- The Carer/Family Helper (45-55) <a name="secondary-avatar"></a>

### 3.1 Demographics

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | David (representative name; could equally be "Sarah" -- women make up 91% of sandwich generation carers) |
| **Age** | 48-53 |
| **Gender** | Predominantly female (91% of sandwich carers are women), but men increasingly involved, especially for financial/admin tasks. |
| **Location** | Lives in a different suburb or town from parent. May be metro Sydney while parent is regional, or vice versa. |
| **Income** | Dual-income household, $120,000-$180,000 combined. Middle class. Own mortgage. |
| **Living Situation** | Married/partnered with school-age or young adult children. Classic "sandwich generation." |
| **Employment** | Full-time professional. 52% report increased stress at work due to caregiving responsibilities. |
| **Digital Literacy** | High. Comfortable with technology, smartphones, apps, online banking. Uses technology daily for work. |

### 3.2 The Sandwich Generation Reality

This avatar is part of the estimated **1.5 million middle-aged Australians** in the sandwich generation:

- **2.65 million** unpaid carers exist in Australia (ABS 2024).
- **11.9% of the population** are carers, including 1.2 million primary carers.
- **9 in 10** carers have experienced signs of caregiving burnout.
- Top symptoms: emotional exhaustion (47%), sleep disturbances (46%), physical exhaustion (45%).
- **48%** say caregiving affects their social life.
- **42%** experience burnout and fatigue.
- **39%** use more personal leave from work.
- Sandwich carers contribute an average of **$1,500/month** to support aging parents.

### 3.3 Their Frustrations

1. **Time poverty**
   - Cannot spend 45 minutes on hold with Centrelink during work hours.
   - Government offices close at 5pm -- the same time they finish work.
   - Weekends spent trying to decipher government letters that arrived at Mum's house during the week.
   - "I spent my entire Saturday trying to figure out Mum's pension reassessment."

2. **Knowledge gap**
   - Digitally capable but **not an expert in government entitlements**.
   - Can navigate a website easily, but doesn't know what to search for.
   - "I don't know what I don't know. I don't even know the right questions to ask."

3. **Emotional labour**
   - Playing the role of translator between parent and government.
   - Parent gets anxious, calls them at work panicking about a Centrelink letter.
   - Navigating parent's pride ("I don't need help") vs reality ("But you do, Mum").
   - Guilt about not doing enough / not being there in person.

4. **Permission and authority barriers**
   - Cannot act on parent's behalf without formal authorisation.
   - Centrelink requires either Power of Attorney or a nominee arrangement.
   - Setting up nominee access through Centrelink is itself a bureaucratic process.
   - "I'm trying to help, and the system is designed to make it harder."

5. **Information is parent-specific**
   - Generic government advice doesn't help. They need answers specific to Mum's situation.
   - "Mum has $X in super, owns her home worth $Y, gets Z per fortnight. What happens when Dad goes into aged care?"
   - This level of personalisation doesn't exist in current government channels.

6. **Coordination across multiple agencies**
   - Need to deal with Centrelink, Medicare, My Aged Care, ATO, state government services, private health funds -- all separately.
   - Each has different login systems, processes, and requirements.
   - No single place to get a coherent picture.

### 3.4 What David Wants from a Tool Like L.I.S.T.

- **Plain-English answers to specific scenarios:** "Mum's husband just died. What does she need to do with Centrelink? In what order? By when?"
- **A checklist:** Step-by-step guide for life events, not a wall of text.
- **Speed:** Get the answer in 2 minutes, not 2 hours of phone calls.
- **Reliability:** Trust that the information is current and correct.
- **Shareable output:** Something they can print or send to Mum to explain what's happening.
- **After-hours availability:** Can use it at 9pm on a Tuesday after the kids are in bed.
- **No need to create yet another government account.** Existing government login fatigue is real.

### 3.5 David's Journey

| Stage | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| **Trigger** | Parent calls in distress about a government letter, pension change, or health event. |
| **First action** | Googles the issue. Gets buried in government websites, forums, conflicting advice. |
| **Escalation** | Calls Centrelink on parent's behalf. Faces wait times. May not have authority to act. |
| **Frustration** | Spends 3-4 hours across multiple days trying to resolve what should be a simple question. |
| **Resolution** | Eventually pieces together an answer from multiple sources. Not always confident it's correct. |
| **Emotional toll** | Resentment builds. Relationship with parent strained. Work productivity drops. |

## 4. Tertiary Avatar: "Karen" -- The Early Retiree (55-64) <a name="tertiary-avatar"></a>

### 4.1 Demographics

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Karen (representative name) |
| **Age** | 58-63 |
| **Gender Split** | Roughly even. Women retire slightly earlier (average 62.7) than men (average 64.9). |
| **Location** | Suburban NSW. May be planning a sea/tree change to regional area. |
| **Income** | Transitional. May have redundancy payout, super drawdown, part-time work income. Not yet eligible for Age Pension (minimum age 67). |
| **Living Situation** | Owns home (possibly still with mortgage). Partner may still be working. |
| **Digital Literacy** | Moderate-to-high. ADII gap only -3.8 points vs national average for 55-64 age group. Used computers throughout career. Comfortable with email, online banking, smartphones. |

### 4.2 The Transition Challenge

Karen is in a unique position:
- **Still digitally capable** but finding government systems increasingly complex.
- **First time dealing with Centrelink** since perhaps their 20s (if ever). The system has changed completely.
- **Complex financial situation:** Super access rules, transition-to-retirement strategies, tax implications, and eventual Age Pension eligibility all intersect in confusing ways.
- **Planning horizon:** Needs to make decisions now that will affect their financial position for decades.

### 4.3 Key Scenarios Karen Faces

1. **"Can I retire at 60?"**
   - Needs to understand the gap between stopping work and Age Pension at 67.
   - Super access rules: can access super from age 60 (if born after 1 July 1964).
   - Transition to retirement strategies: only available from age 60.
   - Tax implications of super drawdown vs employment income.

2. **"What am I eligible for before the Age Pension?"**
   - May be eligible for JobSeeker Payment (with modified mutual obligations for 55+).
   - Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (if not quite eligible for pension).
   - Low Income Health Care Card.
   - Doesn't know these exist or how to apply.

3. **"What happens to my super and pension when I sell the house?"**
   - Downsizer super contribution rules (up to $300,000 per person from sale of home).
   - Impact on future Age Pension assets test.
   - Interaction between super balance and pension eligibility.

4. **"My company offered me a redundancy. What do I need to know?"**
   - Tax treatment of redundancy payments.
   - Impact on Centrelink waiting periods.
   - Whether to roll money into super or invest elsewhere.

5. **"My partner needs aged care. What happens to our finances?"**
   - Means-tested care fees.
   - Protected person provisions (partner still in the family home).
   - Impact on combined pension assessment.

### 4.4 Karen's Digital Relationship

- **Capable but impatient:** Can use government websites but gets frustrated by complexity and information overload.
- **Compares to private sector:** "If I can do my banking in 30 seconds, why does Centrelink take 45 minutes?"
- **Researches before acting:** Will read multiple sources. Wants to feel confident before submitting anything.
- **Higher expectations:** Expects modern UX. Notices bad design.
- **Mobile-first:** Increasingly using smartphone for research and tasks.
- **Will abandon:** If a government process is too hard, will delay (possibly missing deadlines or entitlements).

### 4.5 What Karen Wants from L.I.S.T.

- **Scenario modelling:** "If I retire at 62, what benefits can I access and when?"
- **Jargon translation:** "What does 'deemed income' actually mean for me?"
- **Sequencing:** "What should I do first, second, third?"
- **Confidence:** "Am I understanding this correctly?"
- **Comparison:** "What's the difference between these two options?"
- **Currency:** "Is this information up to date?" (Government rules change frequently.)

## 6. Product Implications & Design Principles <a name="product-implications"></a>

### For Margaret (Primary):
- **Large, readable text** as default. Minimum 16px body, 20px+ headings.
- **High contrast** colour scheme. No light grey text on white backgrounds.
- **Minimal navigation.** One question, one answer. No complex menus.
- **Trust signals everywhere:** ".gov.au source" badges, "Information current as of [date]" labels, clear privacy statements.
- **No login required** for basic queries. Account creation is a massive barrier.
- **Print-friendly output.** Many in this cohort will print the answer.
- **Plain English only.** Every government acronym must be expanded and explained.
- **"Did this answer your question?"** feedback mechanism -- simple yes/no, not a 5-star rating.

### For David (Secondary):
- **Fast, specific answers.** No preamble. Get to the point.
- **Life-event checklists.** "Parent passed away? Here's what to do, in order, with deadlines."
- **Shareable via link, email, or PDF.** David needs to send this to Mum or siblings.
- **Mobile-optimised.** David is using this on his phone at 9pm.
- **Save/bookmark scenarios.** "I'll need to come back to this."
- **No government account needed.** David doesn't want another login.

### For Karen (Tertiary):
- **Scenario comparison.** "Retire at 62 vs 65 -- what changes?"
- **Calculator-style tools** for pension eligibility, assets test impact, super drawdown.
- **Clear timelines.** "At age 60, you can do X. At 67, Y becomes available."
- **Link to authoritative sources.** Karen will want to verify.
- **Modern, clean interface.** Karen notices and cares about UX quality.

### Universal Principles:
1. **No jargon. Ever.** If a government term must be used, explain it immediately.
2. **Source everything.** Every answer should cite the specific government source.
3. **Date everything.** Government rules change. Users must know if information is current.
4. **Empathy in tone.** These are people dealing with stressful life events, not "users" completing "transactions."
5. **Never assume digital literacy.** Don't say "click here" -- say "press the blue button that says..."
6. **Fail gracefully.** If the tool can't answer, direct them to a human (with phone number and best times to call).
7. **Australian English.** "Centre" not "Center." "Organisation" not "Organization." Cultural familiarity builds trust.
8. **No dark patterns.** No upsells, no data harvesting, no newsletter popups. This audience is hyper-alert to anything that feels like a scam.
